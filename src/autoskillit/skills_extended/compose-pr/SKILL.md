# Compose PR

Read the PR prep file from `prepare-pr`, validate arch-lens diagrams, compose the PR body,
and create the GitHub PR via `gh pr create`.

This skill Does NOT invoke any sub-skills or slash commands. It is Part 3 of 3 in the
decomposed PR flow (prepare → run_arch_lenses → compose).

## Arguments

`/autoskillit:compose-pr {prep_path} {all_diagram_paths} {work_dir} {base_branch} [closing_issue]`

- **prep_path** — Absolute path to the PR prep file from `prepare-pr`
- **all_diagram_paths** — Quoted comma-separated absolute paths to diagram `.md` files
  (may be empty string if no lenses succeeded)
- **work_dir** — Worktree root (for deriving `feature_branch` via `git rev-parse`)
- **base_branch** — PR target branch
- **closing_issue** (optional) — GitHub issue number for `Closes #N`

## Critical Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Invoke any sub-skills or slash commands
- Fail the pipeline if `gh` is unavailable — emit `pr_url = ` (empty) and exit successfully
- Create files outside `{{AUTOSKILLIT_TEMP}}/compose-pr/`
- Invent mermaid classDef colors — when embedding validated diagrams, include them verbatim.
  Using ONLY classDef styles from the mermaid skill (no invented colors).

**ALWAYS:**
- Check `gh auth status` before attempting GitHub operations
- Emit `pr_url` token (empty string when GitHub unavailable)
- Validate diagrams with ★ or ● markers before including them
- Degrade gracefully when `all_diagram_paths` is empty or all diagrams fail validation
  (omit Architecture Impact section; do not include a placeholder)
- Handle `no diagrams` case: when `all_diagram_paths is empty` or every path fails
  marker check, set `validated_diagrams = []` and omit the Architecture Impact section

## Context Limit Behavior

When context is exhausted mid-execution, temp files may be written but the PR may
not yet be created. The recipe routes to `on_context_limit` (typically
`release_issue_failure`), bypassing the normal completion protocol.

**Before emitting structured output tokens:**
1. Emit `pr_url = ` (empty) if the PR was not successfully created
2. Emit whatever was completed; the orchestrator will handle the context-limit route

## Workflow

### Step 0: Parse Arguments and Initialize

Parse positional arguments:
- arg[1] = `prep_path`
- arg[2] = `all_diagram_paths` (may be empty string)
- arg[3] = `work_dir`
- arg[4] = `base_branch`
- arg[5] = `closing_issue` (optional — overrides value in prep file if set)

Derive `feature_branch` and set shell variables:
```bash
FEATURE_BRANCH=$(git -C $WORK_DIR rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
BASE_BRANCH=$4
```

Create temp dir (relative to the current working directory):
```bash
mkdir -p {{AUTOSKILLIT_TEMP}}/compose-pr/
ts=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S)
```
Timestamp `ts` is assigned in the bash block above.

### Step 1: Read PR Prep File

Read the file at `prep_path`. Extract:
- `task_title` (from `## Title` section)
- Plan summaries (from `## Plan Summary` — detect single vs multi-plan by presence of group headings)
- `requirements_section` (from `## Requirements` — empty if section is blank)
- `conflict_resolution_table` (from `## Conflict Resolution Table` — empty if section is blank)
- `new_files` (from `## Changed Files > ### New (★):`)
- `modified_files` (from `## Changed Files > ### Modified (●):`)
- `feature_branch` from `## Metadata` (use the git-derived value from Step 0 if set)
- `closing_issue` from `## Metadata` (overridden by arg[5] if arg[5] is non-empty)

### Step 2: Read and Validate Diagrams

Split `all_diagram_paths` by comma; trim whitespace from each path.

For each path:
1. Read the file
2. Extract mermaid block(s)
3. Check for `★` or `●` character in the mermaid block
   - If found → add to `validated_diagrams`
   - If not found → discard silently

If `all_diagram_paths` is empty or all diagrams fail → `validated_diagrams = []`.

### Step 3: Compose PR Body

Write PR body to `{{AUTOSKILLIT_TEMP}}/compose-pr/pr_body_$ts.md` (using the `ts` variable from Step 0).

#### Single plan format:

```markdown
## Summary

{First paragraph of the plan's ## Summary section, or first 5 lines after the heading}

{If requirements_section is non-empty:}
## Requirements

{requirements_section}

{If conflict_resolution_table is non-empty:}
## Conflict Resolution Decisions

The following files had merge conflicts that were automatically resolved.

{## Architecture Impact — include ONLY if validated_diagrams is non-empty:}
## Architecture Impact

### {Lens Name} Diagram

{If closing_issue is non-empty:}
Closes #{closing_issue}

## Implementation Plan

### Step 4: Check GitHub Availability

Run:
```bash
gh auth status 2>/dev/null
```

If exit code is non-zero:
- Log: "GitHub CLI not available or not authenticated — skipping PR creation"
- Output: `pr_url = ` (empty)
- Exit successfully

### Step 5: Create Pull Request

```bash
gh pr create \
  --base $BASE_BRANCH \
  --head $FEATURE_BRANCH \
  --title "$TASK_TITLE" \
  --body-file {{AUTOSKILLIT_TEMP}}/compose-pr/pr_body_$ts.md
```

Capture PR URL from stdout.

## Output

Emit these structured output tokens (literal plain text, no markdown decoration):

On success:
```
pr_url = https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/N
```

On graceful degradation (no `gh` or not authenticated):
```
pr_url = 
```
